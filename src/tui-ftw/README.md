# tui-ftw — private TUI experiments

This folder contains private experiment folders for different TUI frameworks and prompt libraries.

Structure:
- `opentui/` — OpenTUI experiment
- `reactive_tui/` — Reactive TUI (Rust/TS) experiment
- `blessed-contrib/` — blessed-contrib demo
- `sveltui/` — SvelTUI experiment
- `rezi/` — Rezi experiment
- `chalk/` — Chalk styling experiments
- `clack/` — @clack/prompts experiments
- `enquirer/` — Enquirer experiments

Notes
- These demos are intentionally private and are NOT linked from the landing page.
- To run a demo: import the demo component (e.g. `src/tui-ftw/opentui/index.tsx`) into `App.tsx` or open via a temporary route.
- No back-end changes; experiments are client-side only unless you request otherwise.
